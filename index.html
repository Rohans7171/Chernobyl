            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Chernobyl Incident was a catastrophic nuclear accident that occurred on April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the city of Pripyat, which was then part of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. It is considered one of the
                most devastating nuclear disasters in history.
                The disaster was caused by a combination of design flaws in the RBMK reactor, a flawed safety culture, and operator error during a safety test.
                The explosion and subsequent fire released a substantial amount of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, spreading over a large area of Europe. The
                immediate aftermath resulted in the deaths of two plant workers from the explosion and the acute radiation sickness of many others.
                The long-term effects of the Chernobyl disaster have been profound. The nearby town of Pripyat was evacuated, and a large exclusion zone was established around the plant, rendering it largely uninhabitable.
                The disaster had devastating environmental and health consequences, with increased rates of cancer and other health issues reported in affected regions.

            <h2>Why Chernobyl Incident occurred?</h2>
            <p>The Chernobyl incident happened because of a combination of mistakes and
                technical problems. During a test at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, operators made errors in following safety procedures.
                They didn't realize that the reactor was becoming dangerously unstable. This led to a sudden and powerful explosion that blew off the reactor's roof and released a huge amount of radioactive materials into the air. The explosion and the fires that followed spread harmful radiation over a large area, causing a major disaster.
                The explosion and subsequent fires released harmful radioactive particles, including cesium, strontium, and plutonium, into the air. These particles spread over a vast area, affecting not only Ukraine but also neighboring Belarus, Russia, and other parts of Europe.
                The fallout had severe consequences for human health and the environment. The immediate area around the plant, known as the "Chernobyl Exclusion Zone," remains heavily contaminated and largely uninhabitable.
                The Chernobyl Incident is considered one of the most devastating nuclear disasters in history, and it led to significant changes in nuclear safety practices worldwide. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of proper safety measures when dealing with nuclear energy.

            <h2>How It Could Be Prevented</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Better training for operators.</li>
                <li>More rigorous safety protocols.</li>
                <li>Emphasis on a safety-first culture.</li>
                <li>Improvements in reactor design and technology.</li>
